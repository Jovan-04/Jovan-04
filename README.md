## Hey, I'm Evan. 
I'm currently a third-year student at Drake University studying Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. I'm particularly interested in applying programming to the physical world using microcontrollers and other electronics.

### A few of my favorite projects
* Hangman - a [client](https://github.com/Jovan-04/hangman-client-rust) and [server](https://github.com/Jovan-04/hangman-server-rust) to play popular whiteboard game Hangman over a network
* [Binary Clock](https://github.com/Jovan-04/binary-clock) - A physical clock that tells the time with LEDs displaying binary strings, all with an Arduino microcontroller.
* [Minecraft Utility Bot](https://github.com/Jovan-04/utility-bot) - A modular bot able to automate various tasks of survival Minecraft, such as farming crops. Built with the Mineflayer Node.js library.
* [Audio-Converter](https://github.com/Jovan-04/ffmpeg-converter) - A short bash script to convert batches of audio files between formats, replicating the directory structure.
* [EDNA - Edible Data & Numerical Analysis](https://github.com/Jovan-04/recipe-web-scraper) - An ElectronJS application that calculates a recipe's cost based on pricing data scraped from various retailers.
